# Bronze Age
Stranded alone on the RimWorld, with nothing on your back, and no knowledge in your mind. You're surrounded by trees, rocks, and bugs. You must start your own civilization from scratch, relearning all of history and surviving using your own wits.

Starting around the agricultural revolution in human history, when we first started using metal tools and transitioning from roaming hunter-gatherer tribes to fixed cities, Bronze Age is a survival-focused kitchen-sink RimWorld mod pack to relive this era, and advance all the way to the stars.

## What Is This Mod?
Bronze Age is both a mod pack and a "mod glue" mod. RimWorld has hundreds of amazing mods, but because it has so many, they can tend to step on each others' feet, not be balanced against each other, duplicate functionality, or simply not work together at all.

Bronze Age takes these mods and smashes them together with a bit of grease, fixing all of the incompatibilities along the way. There are many thousands of lines of patches for everything in this pack. The goal is for all mods to run smoothly together, feel great together, and create the best modded RimWorld experience possible. If you have heard of "Feed the Beast" for Minecraft, Bronze age takes a similar, if slightly more opinionated, approach.

As per the name, Bronze Age is a survival-style modpack tailored around epic colonies that start in the Neolithic era. Starting with almost no research, your colonists must research their way up the completely revamped, massive, tech tree. With almost every facet of the game changed by one mod or another, your old RimWorld strategies may not work any more. Colonists have far more needs, personalities, and dangers, and keeping them alive can be far harder than in vanilla RimWorld.

### Core Mods
Bronze Age is generally balanced around these core mods:

* **Simple Chains** - Steel, leather, and lumber must all be processed before being used!
* **Human Resources** - A pawn learning a research only means the one pawn knows it - they must then share that knowledge with others. Weapons cannot be used until researched, and trained with!
* **Hygiene** - Hygiene and water needs from Dubs Bad Hygiene add additional survival needs!
* **SeedsPlease** - You can't plant anything! You must find or buy seeds to plant crops!

Other mods are also designed around, but the whole list doesn't need to be here. You can find the full mod list on the [GitHub Wiki][1].

### Philosophy
Bronze Age has been designed around how I play RimWorld. It's likely not the same as how you play, and it's likely that I enjoy mods that you don't. I started making this mod to fix bugs and inconsistencies from installing too many mods, and this mod kept expanding more and more into a Neolithic-era survival modpack. I enjoy starting from nothing and making a colony from there.

As more mods were added, certain frustrations came up, and Bronze Age came in to give a solution (with caveats, of course) to that problem when playing early on. Bronze Age is not currently balanced around the industrial and spacer eras, but that's not to say that it couldn't be, simply that that hasn't been done yet.

The goal is to give a smooth progression from neolithic all the way up to spacer, while cramming in as many mods and features as possible.  However, Bronze Age is opinionated about which features of mods to keep and which to get rid of. For example, if two mods add a crossbow, only one crossbow will be kept. Deciding between two nearly identical crossbows isn't fun for the player.

## Installation

1. Subscribe to Bronze Age on the steam workshop (as well as its direct dependencies).
2. Run the Setup Wizard once the game has launched. The Setup Wizard will install the Bronze Age config files, subscribe to the Bronze Age mods, set up the mod load order, and then restart the game.
3. Make any tweaks that you like at this point (it's recommended to try the complete Bronze Age pack for a while first).

## FAQs
#### Q: The game takes a long time to load!
Yes!

#### Q: The game runs slow!
Yes!

That said, patching the performance of both mods and RimWorld is one of the goals with Bronze Age, so performance fixes should be coming soon. RimThreaded looks like an awesome project, but doesn't seem to be ready for this quite yet.

#### Q: Can I add mod [X] for myself?
Probably! Try adding the mod, and see if any errors pop up. Sometimes errors are harmless, other times compatibility needs to be added manually.
If you find a mod that is incompatible, please report it to the [GitHub issue tracker][1] so that compatibility can be added, even if the mod is not part
of the Bronze Age pack.

Try to keep Bronze Age at or near the very bottom of your mod load order. Think of Bronze Age as "gift-wrapping" the rest of your mods.

Mods that are probably not compatible (however have not been tried yet):
* Combat Extended
* Multiplayer
* RimThreaded

If you would like to help in making these mods compatible, head over to the [GitHub page][1] to help out!

#### Q: Can you add mod [X] to the pack?
Maybe! Bronze Age in general tries to keep to the vanilla RimWorld aesthetic, while expanding upon it. Mods adding things like magic and fantasy elements are probably not the best suited for this pack (psychic abilities are _totally_ different, sheesh).

In general, I have a "more mods is better" approach to this mod pack.

Go ahead and make a request on the [GitHub issue page][1] for the mod to be added to the pack!

#### Q: Can I remove mod [Y] from the pack?
Probably! Bronze Age should be able to run fine with mods removed from it, however some mods are more expected than others, so you may get weird behavior and the balancing may no longer be correct. The wizard should show you which mods are Core and which mods are Pack. Removing Pack mods should be safe to do.

In general, you can remove UI mods or AI mods without much worry. Removing mods which add buildings, items, and research may cause problems.

#### Q: Can I change the configuration for the mods?
Sure, changing any configuration setting to suit your needs should be fine. Bronze Age is balanced around certain survival settings such as water needs, but if they aren't fun for you, then feel free to turn them off.

#### Q: I don't like [X] decision that was made!
Alright! Open an issue on the [GitHub issue tracker][1] and I'm happy to discuss it!

#### Q: Couldn't you have done this with many small patch mods?
To a lesser extent, yes, however the amount of work to create and maintain the excessive number of patch mods would not have been worth the effort. By ensuring the Bronze Age runs last, it can be sure to fix incompatibilities without any problems. If you would like to take any of these patches into your own mods, feel free to. Also let me know, so I can remove the patch from this mod!

## Credits
This mod pack could not have been created without the amazing efforts of so many RimWorld modders. I take absolutely no credit for anything they have made which ends up in this pack.

Modders whose mods appear in this pack (alphabetically):

1. [TODO]

A number of small patch mods have been directly integrated into this mod, to improve loading speed and reduce the number of mods in the mods list. The integrated patches are:

1. [TODO]

## Additional Notes
If you are a modder and you wish for your mod to not be in this pack, I may publicly shame you for such a silly decision, but will remove the mod without argument.
